# LMS (Learning Management System)
- It will be a learning management system for several institutes and each institution has many departments which have several teachers and students.
It also has a lot of different features like a chat system between students and teachers, quizzes, attendance, and homework.
- In these project weeks we will work on the frontend of this project and attach it to the backend that we already built.
